# Tag Input

Write a react component which will serve as an input for the spices used in cooking a dish. The component will allow users to easily search a list of suggested spices and add them to a list of selected spices. The input will also allow users to add spices which are not in the list of suggested spices. This component will eventually be used with an api that accepts a search string and returns a list of spice suggestions. Try to build it in such a way that you could use it unchanged when interacting a server.

## What it looks like

![tag input preview](https://github.com/shefhq/take-home-interview/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-07%20at%2011.58.47%20AM.png)

## Requirements:

1. The component must provide AT LEAST the following props:
    - values: an array of strings representing the currently selected spices
    - onChange: a function which will fire any time 'values' changes

Example:
```
const App = () => {
  const [selectedSpices, setSelectedSpices] = useState([]);
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Any other props you think are necessary can be added, too */}
      <YourComponentHere values={selectedSpices} onChange={setSelectedSpices} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
2. Render a list of the currently selected spices in-line with the cursor for adding new spices (see blue boxes in screenshot)
1. Each currently selected spice can be removed from the list by clicking the 'x'
1. As the user types into the input, display a list of suggested spices (see white bubble in screenshot)
1. If the user presses 'enter' while typing:
    - If there are any suggested spices, add the first one to the list of selected spices
    - If no suggestions, add the string that the user typed to the list of selected spices (i.e. allow users to add spices which are not on the list)
    - Then clear out the typed text
1. If the user hits 'backspace':
    - If the input is not selected, don't do anything
    - If there is text that was typed by the user, backspace should behave normally (deleting any selected text, or the character immediately to the left of the cursor)
    - If there is no text that was typed by the user, remove the most recently added spice from the list of selected spices
    - If there are no selected spices, do nothing
1. If the user clicks on a suggestion
    - Add it to the list of suggested spices
    - Clear out the typed text
1. A clean api for dealing with asynchronus data sources
    - Handle latency
    - Handle failed requests

## Hints

1. We recommend you prioritize based on the following rubric:
   - Finish [the requirements](https://github.com/shefhq/take-home-interview/blob/rubric/tag-input.md#requirements) (50%)
     - Focus on functionality before style - things do not need to look identical to the example image.
   - Ensure high code quality (30%)
     - Readable, reusable code that you would feel comfortable deploying to production.
     - Components should be broken out in a thoughtful way.
   - User Experience (20%)
      - Ease of use, design, and performance

1. This type of component exists all over the internet, but we want to see you write your own. Third party libraries are OK to use, unless they completely trivialize the project (you should implement the core requirements yourself). Use your best judgement, and reach out to your interviewer if you are unsure.
